# Car Price Prediction

This project is an interactive web application that predicts car prices based on various features such as brand, model, year, mileage, and more. It helps users estimate the market value of a car using machine learning models.  

### **Features**  
- Interactive dashboard for predicting car prices  
- Data filtering by car brand, model, year, and other attributes  
- Statistical insights, including average, minimum, and maximum predicted prices  
- Scatter plot for price distribution and histogram for data visualization  
- Streamlit-based web application for a seamless user experience  

### **Tools & Technologies Used**  
- **Python** for data preprocessing and model development  
- **Streamlit** for building the web application  
- **Pandas** for data manipulation  
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning model training  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualizations  

### **Dataset**  
- Contains car details such as brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and price  
- Data is preprocessed, including handling missing values and feature encoding  
- Used for training machine learning models to predict car prices accurately  

### **Deployment**  
- The application is deployed on **Streamlit Cloud** for easy access and real-time predictions.
